# About me

Avid soccer player and supporter, even though I enjoy all sports in general. Played 5 years for Grant Macewan University and placed 4th at Canada's u18 Youth National tournament. Big music enthusiast, I've been producing and writing music for almost a decade. [Click here](https://soundcloud.com/r1comadeit) to see what I spend most of my time on. I also grew up on Nintendo 64 and Xbox so now I basically play any games I can get my hands on. I took french immersion from K-12, proficient in reading, writing and speaking.
